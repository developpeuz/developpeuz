## YOU HAVE A NEW PROJECT
I am able to create a complete graphic identity based on your graphic charter. I am autonomous in cutting out mockups and I thrive fully in integration (HTML, CSS and Javascript).

## YOU ARE A GRAPHIC DESIGNER
I worked in a communication agency and I am used to integrating mockups: starting from scratch, bootstrap, wordpress, prestashop, symfony (twig), etc.

##YOU ARE A BACK-END DEVELOPER (and you're bored with the front)
##YOU ARE A TEAM OF DEVELOPERS
I'm used to working in a team with back-end developers, especially on Symfony, but I like a challenge, what else do you have to offer me?
Whether it's for a new project, change of graphic charter, change of version, developments, etc.
⭐ Do you work fully remote with docker and agile method?
⭐ Where do I sign to be part of the team and who brings the croissants? :)
